# DOG-AND-CAT-DATASET
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset. Images are preprocessed, resized, and converted into feature vectors before training the SVM model. The trained model learns to distinguish between cat and dog images and predicts the class of new images accurately.
